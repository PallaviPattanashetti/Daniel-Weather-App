 Peer Review (Daniel Herrera): I like seeing my project coming to life. Thank you: Here is a list of suggestions I would like to see implemented!


 Header from day and night mode is inconsistent: "Weather Forecast API text has different size between the two pages.

 I get an error when I hit the enter key on the input field: it tries to open a page that doesn't exist /search?city-search=

 Favorites are inconsistent with dark mode. Dark mode is missing the red x button

 Top 5 Favorites List text in dark mode needs to change to a white color.
